# In this exercise, use the bokeh Python library to plot a
# histogram of which months the scientists have birthdays in!
# Because it would take a long time for you to input the months
# of various scientists, you can use my scientist birthday JSON
# file. Just parse out the months (if you donâ€™t know how, I
# suggest looking at the previous exercise or its solution)
# and draw your histogram.
